## macOS Installer

A macOS installer is available for this application. To build the installer:

```bash
# Make the build script executable
chmod +x build_installer.sh

# Run the build script
./build_installer.sh
```

This will create a DMG installer file (`BLE Kafka Scanner.dmg`) in the root directory of the project.

For more information about the installer, see the [Installer README](scanner/installer/INSTALLER_README.md).
